This is a uGB Wrapper for Palm OS.

DO NOT USE THE EMULATOR CORE WITHOUT AUTHOR EXPRESSION PERMISSION:
- Emulator core author: https://dmitry.gr/

## Downloads
You can find the binaries (the .prc file) in the release section of Github. [Or click here to go right to the latest version](https://github.com/Tavisco/ugb-palm-os/releases/latest). Do not mirror it elsewhere without my express permission.

## Device minimum requirements
- Palm OS 5.0 or greater
- An SD Card slot
- Physical buttons working (as of now. And you probably want a device with 5-way navigator, and four hard-buttons)

## How to install and use the emulator
- Copy the emulator file (PRC) into the Launcher folder on your SD Card. The folder is located at `/Palm/Launcher`.
- Create a new folder called `/Palm/Programs/uGB/` on your SD Card.
- Add your Game Boy and Game Boy Color game files (files with .gb and .gbc extensions) to this folder.
- Launch uGB from the application launcher.
- Go to the Options menu, select Key Binding, and customize your key bindings to your liking and save your settings.
- Select a game from your library, and click the Launch button to start the emulation.
- Have fun playing your favorite Game Boy games! When you're done, hit the on-screen Stop button, as it's in this moment that the progress is actually saved to the SD Card.
